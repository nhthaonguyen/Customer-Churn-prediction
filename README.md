# Customer-Churn-prediction
After EDA and modeling evaluation, Logistic Regression model is considered as a most efficient model to predict customer probability to churn. 
For analysis purpose, I visualize profile of total customer and churn customer to have general vision. Then, based on feature importance and model prediction, only features that affect on customer churn decision are visualized on Tableau public dashboard.

Toolkit in this analysis: 
sklearn
pandas
matplotlib
PowerBI
Tableau

Summarize current customer versus churner by Power BI 

Customer Profile (predict whether with this customer profile, will they churn or not) by Tableau Public
